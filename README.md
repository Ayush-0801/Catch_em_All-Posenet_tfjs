# Catch_em_All-Posenet_tfjs
A simple browser-based 2D game by extending TensorFlow.js posenet library.

<h2>Overview</h2>

Catch'am All is an AR game which uses the pose detection model by TensorFlow to track the user's hands and progress the game accordingly. The score is updated everytime the user's hands overlap with the oncoming ball on the screen. The user gets three lives/chances to get the maximum score possible.

<h2>Implementation </h2>
The project is implemented using JavaScript libraries and majorly revolves around the posenet model of tensorflow.js.

The implementation steps involved are:
- [x] Accessing WebCam
- [x] Loading Posenet Model
- [x] Setting up a Game Engine (PIXI.js)
- [x] Connecting Pose Detection and Object Overlap with Score Counter
- [x] Adding Sound Effects and General UI
